        <h2>
            WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Fishbole, the online service of Fishbole Pty Ltd (“Fishbole,” “we,” or “us”). Our Privacy Policy
            explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your
            choices about the collection and use of your information. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this
            Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in our Terms of Use. If you do not agree with this Privacy
            Policy in general or any part of it, you should not use our online services.
        </p>

        <h2>
            1. Information we collect and its use
        </h2>
        <p>
            We collect the following types of information about you:
        </p>

        <h3>
            (a) Information you provide us directly
        </h3>
        <p>
            We may ask for certain information such as a username, your first and last names, birthdate, phone number,
            profession and e-mail address when you register for a Fishbole account, or if you correspond with us. We
            also collect any messages you send us through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User
            Content you post to the Service (such as video and images you upload to use in your video presentations). We
            use this information to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of the Service to you,
            to correspond with you, and to address any issues you raise about the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>
            (b) Information we collect from you automatically
        </h3>
        <p>
            We will directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and
            usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device,
            including the pages you visit and other information (in respect of which, please see the paragraph on log
            file information below) that assists us in improving the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>
            (c) Cookies information and information taken from similar technologies
        </h3>
        <p>
            When you visit the Service, we will send cookies — small text files containing a string of alphanumeric
            characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Fishbole help you log in faster
            and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use
            the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and
            allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time.<br />
            You can control or reset your cookies and similar technologies through your web browser, which will allow
            you to customise your cookie preferences and to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being
            sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is
            disabled.
        </p>

        <h3>
            (d) Log file information
        </h3>
        <p>
            Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the
            Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These
            server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
            browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the
            Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Clear gifs/web beacons information
        </h3>
        <p>
            When you use the Service, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously
            track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails
            sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. This
            information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>
            (f) Device identifiers
        </h3>
        <p>
            When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or
            tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a
            universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures
            stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device
            identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the
            device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Fishbole. A device identifier may
            convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain
            persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some
            features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired
            or disabled.
        </p>

        <h2>
            2. Requested account permissions

            <li>For data analytics: We use information about you to help us improve the Fishbole Service and our
                users’ experience, including by monitoring aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors,

            <li>You consent to us using your information in a certain way – for example, to hear about new features
                or offers.</li>

            right to object to that use. However, if you do so it may mean that it is not possible for you to continue
            using the Services.<br />

            The laws of some countries grant particular rights in respect of personal information. In certain
            circumstances, users in the EEA have the right to:

            Should you wish to make a request in respect of your personal information please contact us at

            In some circumstances Fishbole will not be able to comply with a request that you make in respect of your
            personal data. For example, we may not be able to provide a copy of your information where it infringes on
            the rights of another User. We may also be required to retain certain information that you ask us to delete
            for various reasons, such as where there is a legal requirement to do so. In some cases, you may have shared
            your information with third parties, such as by publishing content on a third party’s website. In that case
            Fishbole will not be able to delete the information, and you will need to contact that third party
            directly.<br />
            If we are unable to resolve your request, or if you are concerned about a potential violation, you also have
            the option to report the issue or make a complaint to the data protection authority in your jurisdiction.
            Where you have provided your consent to certain processing and no longer want us to use your information for

            FISHBOLE CLASSROOMS: Children under the age of 13 may use our Fishbole classroom service under the
            supervision of their teacher. We will only collect student data where such collection is authorised by
            participating educational institutions who have obtained parental consent. We will share student data with
            our third party service providers solely to the extent necessary for them to perform a business or
            technology support function for us. This may include data processing, account management or the provision of
            usage analytics.<br />
            The following third party service providers will process student data for the sole purpose of delivering the
            Fishbole classroom service. If a school deletes their Fishbole classroom account, or requests the deletion
            of personally identifiable information associated with a student’s account, Fishbole will direct these
            services to delete any such information they hold:

            If a student account is inactive for more than 12 months, we will send an email to the email address
            associated with that account to confirm if the student wishes to continue using the service. If the student
            does not respond within 3 months of receipt of that email and there has been no activity on the account, we
            will delete their account.<br />
            Upon termination of a school’s Fishbole Classroom account, we will delete all student accounts associated
            with that school.
        </p>
        <p>
            Educational institutions will have direct control of student data at all times. If a school wishes to
            inspect, review, amend or delete data we have collected from a student, they may submit an authorised
            request to team@fishbole.io or by any of the contact details provided in section 16 below. Such a request
            must come from the email address that owns the Fishbole account. To protect children’s privacy and security,
            we will take reasonable steps to help verify the school’s identity before granting access to any personal
            information.
