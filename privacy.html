            Fishbole, Inc. (“Fishbole,” “we,” “us,” “our”), knows that you care about how your personal information is
            used and shared, and takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy
            Policy. By visiting the Fishbole’s website at www.Fishbole.io or any of Fishbole's other websites,
            applications, domain names or other linked pages, (collectively the “Website”), or using any of our
            services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. By
            using the Website, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United
            States.
        </p>
        <p>
            You post any Content (as that term is defined in the Fishbole’s Terms of Use located at
            https://www.fishbole.io//terms.html) on the Website at your own risk. Although we may allow you to set
            privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or
            impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your pages and
            information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that Content you post on the Website will not be
            viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security
            measures contained on the Website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of
            Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your

        </p>
        <p>
            Any improper collection or misuse of Content or other information accessible on the Website is a violation
            of the Fishbole’s Terms of Use and should be reported to team@fishbole.io.
        </p>
        <h2>
            WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?
        </h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how Fishbole collects and uses information from its users who access the
            Website and use our services, including Fishbole's treatment of personally identifiable information
            ("Personal Information"). Also, this Privacy Policy covers Fishbole's treatment of any Personal Information
            that Fishbole's business partners share with Fishbole, or that you provide to the Fishbole through a third
            party website using a Fishbole application. This policy does not apply to websites or practices of companies
            that Fishbole does not own or control, or to individuals that Fishbole does not employ or manage.
        </p>
        <h2>
            WHAT INFORMATION DOES FISBHOLE DISPLAY OR COLLECT?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Depending on how you use the Website, you may be required to provide certain personally identifiable
            information ("Personal Information") through your Google Account, which may include, but is not limited to,
            your:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Google Account (Email address)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Name (if you include it in your Google Profile)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your image and likeness if you include it in your Google profile or include in content that you
                    create with our Services (these type of files are referred to as your "User Content")
                </li>
            </ul>
            You may choose not to provide your Personal Information; however, if you do not provide your Personal
            Information you may not be able to use all the functions offered by the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you use the Website, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform
            searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels, as permitted by the functionality
            of the Website. The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services,
            and, in some cases, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile through the Website. In most
            cases, we retain such information so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent
            or easily see your connections list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior
            version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.
            Specifically, we collect the following types of information from our users.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Information You Provide to Us:
        </h3>
        <h4>
            Children’s Personal Information:
        </h4>
        <p>
            Privacy for Students and Children Under 13 Years Old. The entire Fishbole team takes the privacy of students
            and children extremely seriously. We do not intentionally target our services to students or children of any
            kind. Educators that have the authority to act on parent’s behalf may allow students under 13 to use our
            services, if such use is for educational purposes, and if this use ensures that students will not provide
            any personal information and will not share, or otherwise, distribute recordings containing personal
            information of a student.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Information Provided by Users Age 13 and Older:
        </h4>
        <p>
            We receive and store any information you knowingly enter on the Website, whether via computer, mobile phone,
            other wireless device, or that you provide to us in any other way. This information may include your name,
            email address, birthday, password, school affiliation, friend lists, teacher’s name, location, photo, bio
            and any other information necessary for us to provide our services (“Personal Information”). You may choose
            not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of one or more of
            our features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests
            for certain information, products and services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you
            about specials and new features. You may modify or remove your Personal Information at any time by logging
            into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and/or account information.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Information Collected Automatically:
        </h4>
        <p>
            We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Website or our services.
            Fishbole automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your
            IP address, Fishbole cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of your
            activity on the Website. This information is not Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of
            visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a
            particular show. Fishbole only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not
            in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how
            often users use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users
            as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate
            information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of
            statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our partner's' services and the
            Website to help provide you with an optimal online experience.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Email Communications:
        </h4>
        <p>
            If you provide us your email address, we may send you email communications. If you are a child, we will only
            use your email address to send you notifications and newsletters. If you are not a child, we may receive a
            confirmation when you open an email from Fishbole if your computer supports this type of program. Fishbole
            uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our non-child
            user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our
            users.
        </p>
        <h4>
            What About Cookies?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to
            enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by
            how many people. Fishbole cookies do not collect Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information,
            and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information or
            Children’s Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from
            accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to
            decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the
            cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or use many of the Website’s most
            attractive features without cookies enabled.
        </p>
        <h3>
            WILL FISBHOLE SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your
            Personal Information to anyone. However, we share your Personal Information in personally identifiable form
            as described below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your
            information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include sending email, analyzing
            data, and providing user services. Unless we tell you differently, Fishbole's agents do not have any right
            to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to
            our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            User Profiles: You may choose to populate your user profile on the Website with Personal Information,
            including, without limitation, your name, photograph, and school affiliation. This user profile information
            will be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Website or facilitate interaction
            with the Fishbole. However, please keep in mind that information (whether Personal Information or not) or
            content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your
            public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others, in accordance
            with the privacy settings you select in your account preferences. Your user name may be displayed to other
            users when you upload images or videos or send messages through the Website and other users can contact you
            through messages and comments. Any images, captions or other content that you submit to the Websites may be
            redistributed through the Internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.
        </p>
        <p>
            Communication About the Website or in Response to User Requests: As part of the Website and our services,
            you may receive from Fishbole email or other types of communication relating to your use of the Website or
            your user profile. You acknowledge and agree that by posting information on the Website or otherwise using
            the Website, Fishbole and its agents may send you email, contact you or engage in other communication that
            they determine in their sole discretion related to your profile or use of the Website. If you disclose your
            email address to Fishbole we may use it to send updates, a newsletter or other news regarding the Website or
            Fishbole services, or to simply send notifications or newsletters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user
            information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Fishbole, or
            substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Fishbole goes out of business
            or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third
            party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Fishbole may continue to use
            your Personal Information and Children’s Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Protection of Fishbole and Others: We may release Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information
            when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms
            of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Fishbole, our employees, our
            users, or others. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and
            organizations for fraud protection.
        </p>
        <p>
            With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be
            shared with third parties, and will be given the option to prevent the sharing of this information. We make
            sure that all third parties we share data with follow the same privacy and security practices we do as laid
            out in our policies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Children’s Personal Information: Other than as stated above, we never share Children’s Personal Information
            with any third parties.
        </p>
        <h2>
            IS INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Your Fishbole account, Personal Information and/or Children’s Personal Information is protected by a
            password for your privacy and security. You may help protect against unauthorized access to your account and
            Personal Information or Children’s Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password
            appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished
            accessing your account.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fishbole endeavors to protect user information to ensure that user account information is kept private,
            however, Fishbole cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use,
            hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.

        </p>
        <p>
            The Website contains links to other sites. Fishbole is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or
            practices on other sites. When linking to another site a user should read the privacy policy stated on that

            you voluntarily post information to public areas on the Website or any other public forums, such information
            can be accessed by the public.
        </p>
        <h2>
            WHAT INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Fishbole allows you to access the following information about you for the purpose of viewing, and in certain

        <h2>
            WHAT OTHER CHOICES DO I HAVE?
        </h2>
        <p>
            As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information, even though it may be needed to take

        <p>
            You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the “What Information

        </p>
        <p>
            You may request deletion of your Fishbole account by emailing team@fishbole.io. Please note that after 30
            days we will automatically delete all data associated with deleted accounts. Teachers and school
