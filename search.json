The GDPR will replace the EU Data Protection Directive and will apply a single data protection law throughout the EU. Data protection laws govern the way that businesses collect, use, and share personal data about individuals. Among other things, they require businesses to process an individualâ€™s personal data fairly and lawfully, allow individuals to exercise legal rights in respect of their personal data (for example, to access correct or delete their personal data), and ensure appropriate security protections are put in place to protect the personal data they process. We have taken steps for our European students to ensure that we are compliant with the GDPR as of May 25, 2018."},{"question":"What is Fishbole role under GDPR?","answer":"We act as a data controller under GDPR for the EU customer information we collect to operate Fishbole."},{"question":"What personal data does Fishbole collect?","answer":"We store data that customers have given us voluntarily.
